Tracko-Track the changes
Truck pilferage and tracking is a costly problem for mining departments. In India, mining departments lose around $1.5 billion every year due to pilferage and lack of tracking. Our innovative device, Tracko, can be installed in trucks to provide real-time location updates and alerts of location change to the department head while on the move or parked outside.
Tracko is more than just regular GPS tracking devices for tractors, trailers, and trucks. It is the only technology that detects pilferage and enhances data security by assigning unique identifiers to all vehicles containing restricted minerals this ensures privacy and prevents illegally entered data from being collected. An innovative and centralized monitoring system, Tracko guarantees: - 
-	The highest quality and reliability of data
-	Unparalleled user experience and usability
-	Data security for all parties involved
-	Increased accuracy, transparency and efficiency of management
-	Rapid response in case of emergencies 
-	Tracking 
CHAPTER-1 Introduction
1.1	Project Summary & Profile (Details of the Project):-
Tracko optimizes business operations across various sectors including travel agencies, transportation companies and other industries like dairy and food products, mining, mechanical, automobiles, food delivery chains, steel, cement and other industries having fleet management.
This project's goal is to create a highly redundant system that can detect truck pilferage at an early stage and also ensure that the truck is always on route. To accomplish this, the project will include both hardware and software. Our approach to problem solving will be modular. A system will be developed to track trucks transporting minerals. A GPS based system will be installed in the truck for anti-theft and security protection for the specific truck. The system created will fill in the dashboard given in a website and measure different parameters such as location coordinates (latitude, Longitude), speed and direction heading to etc. The system will display the live position on a constant time interval of the truck with route monitoring and geolocation/Geo-fencing will be used to keep the truck on a fixed route all the time.Our strategy to inconvenience fixing will be particular. A gadget will be created to tune vans moving minerals. A GPS based absolutely gadget will be set up in the truck for hostile to robbery and security wellbeing for the exceptional truck. The gadget made will fill in the dashboard given in a web webpage and measure exceptional boundaries, for example, place organizes (scope, Longitude), speed and course going to and so on.
The device will show the stay capability on a steady time frame truck with course observing and geolocation/Geo-fencing will be utilized to hold the truck on a consistent course constantly.
Further this project has multiple use cases such as in:-
•	Public Transport
•	Ambulance Service
•	School Bus
•	Railways
•	Container/Consignment Tracking
 
1.2 Purpose (Why this Project is being made):-
The Purpose of this project is very clear to prevent the truck pilferage amounting close to $ 1.5 Million every year, which has to be paid off by the mining industry and also to increase the productivity and overall use case of a vehicle. At this time, for tracking purposes only physical communications are used and no specific technological solutions are currently available. As well as maps for route purposes like google maps and mapmyindia are used.
These days, the mining sector uses older technologies such as external security for driver communications and vehicle tracking. Along with that, physical tracking of minerals based on the amount of minerals and the entry of employees is carried out. For resource monitoring, physical copies of mineral trucks are kept
To solve all of the above problems we are working on the project.
 
1.3 Scope & Objectives (What it can do and can’t do)
Objectives:-
Reduce Both Wage and Fuel Costs
Without a doubt, wages and fuel are the two biggest expenditures that any business with a fleet of vehicles can incur – meaning that it is imperative to keep these costs as low as possible. With the price of fuel at its highest rate in history, the emphasis is on the business owner to ensure that they are getting the highest fuel economy possible from their vehicles. How can this be helped by installing a tracking device though? Well, a tracking device will allow the business manager to monitor activities that are contributing towards a higher fuel bill – activities such as taking longer routes, speeding and leaving the engine idle when stopped. These might not sound like much, but they all add up to massive savings!
When it comes to wages, tracking systems can protect the business against any dishonest claims made by employees, such as the amount of time they have spent driving and the amount of miles that they need to claim for. Nearly every driver has at some point fiddled their mileage sheets, but with a tracking device the information is with the manager before the driver even fills out his forms! In fact, there is no need for the driver to even fill out forms, as the mileage is already automatically and accurately calculated.
Track Locations
Being able to map out the locations of your fleet means that you will always know who is closest to that vital job or who is simply sitting in a service station and avoiding work! One of the benefits of integrating the system with satellite tracking and other geo location devices means that the driver should also never get lost, as direct routes can be supplied to them straight from the office.
Security Benefits
Vehicles and plants are probably the most valuable assets that a business has in terms of cost, therefore they are often the targets for unscrupulous thieves. Of course, most vehicles are insured against theft, but what about the income lost when the business is unable to work to full capacity? A tracking system will allow any stolen vehicle to be tracked around the country and therefore ensure that it is returned in the quickest amount of time.
 
A tracking system is also an important tool for ensuring the safety of your staff. This is especially true when a business has a workforce that often works alone or in areas where there are potential dangers. Being able to locate an employee who is potentially in danger is something that could save their life – and protect the business from costly legal action.
Increase Customer Service
Many businesses rely on a speedy response to ensure that their customers are happy with the service that they receive. In this highly competitive world, customer service is the one aspect that a business can still stand out in and having a tracking device will ensure that vehicles can be monitored and stationed in the correct places to respond to any customer requests. A tracking system benefits a business by allowing them to immediately tell their customers how long a member of staff will be and also if there are any delays in their response, due to traffic or other external circumstances.
Dispute Resolution Benefits
One of a business manager’s biggest roles is to resolve disputes, either between staff members or between a staff member and a customer. Due to the fact that a tracking system will log the date, time and length of every job attended, there can be no dispute regarding the location and promptness of the job. It can also help to settle staff disputes should one member of staff feel that they are being unfairly treated in terms of the jobs they are sent to.
Improve Staff Members’ Driving
We’ve all seen the van on the motorway doing 100mph, complete with the logo of the company emblazoned on the side, and we have all also thought some extremely negative thoughts about the company that this truck driver works for! The staff of a business are the public face of the whole enterprise and as such poor driving will affect the reputation of the business as a whole – a reputation that most businesses have spent years trying to consolidate. A tracking system will provide information on any unsafe driving to the manager, who can then discuss the issue with the member of staff involved. This benefits both parties as safer driving can help keep insurance costs down and staff members will not need to be reprimanded for their driving habits on an ongoing basis.
Motivate the Staff
Staff that don’t feel cared for are always going to be unproductive staff – that is an irrefutable fact of business. One thing that can really upset staff is being sent to a job alone and feeling that they have no protection should a situation occur – something that is remedied with the installation of a tracking device. With a tracking device, workers will know that they are constantly being monitored and that their employers care about their welfare.
A tracking system also benefits businesses when used as a motivational tool because staff will be more conscious that their work patterns are being monitored. This will prompt them to ensure that they are as efficient as possible, make sure that they attend to jobs on time and don’t make excuses for late arrivals.
Increase Productivity
Linked in with the above topic is the issue of productivity – something that will vastly increase when this system is installed in a vehicle. The driver will know that they are expected to perform a certain amount of tasks throughout the day and that therefore they are unable to simply go around slowly, not making the best use of their time. A tracking system will also decrease the amount of time that the driver has to spend on the phone – something that necessitates that they stop driving – therefore meaning that they can get to locations far more quickly.
Benefits to the Environment
The environment is a hot topic throughout the world. Most companies are bowing to public pressure to decrease the amount of damage that they do to the earth every single day. By using a tracking device a business can be sure that they are always sending their drivers in the right direction and also that they are always asking the closest driver to attend. This minimizes the amount of harmful fumes that a Trucks releases into the atmosphere. Lowered fuel cost benefits to you, and cleaner air benefits our precious earth!
Along with all of the above these will be our core objectives:-
•	The highest quality and reliability of data
•	Unparalleled user experience and usability
•	Data security for all parties involved
•	Increased accuracy, transparency and efficiency of management
•	Rapid response in case of emergencies

In the railway industry, various GPS trackers are used to ensure goods are successfully dispatched from receiving facilities to stations and terminals. These units are also very important. They help identify people illegally accessing trains or the goods in trains. This not only ensures that they can be caught but also assists with preventing or limiting incidents on railways such as temporary theft of goods, dumping of goods or other associated crimes.
In Consignment Tracking:-
Global supply chains face new and evolving challenges and demands. Advanced and real-time visibility and tracking solutions will take your container shipping procedures to the next level. A shipping container GPS tracker that operates on satellite platforms can generate the real-time location of the shipping container at intervals. These discreet cost-effective systems are rugged enough to survive any type of weather conditions, terrain, and handling. They can be used to create geofences and send alerts through integrated software systems when the container departs from the designated region. Through the Internet of Things, the tracking devices and related software provides a platform that brings visibility to all the players on the supply chain.
From all indications, the lucrative container shipping industry will continue to provide profitable opportunities for optimization. Benefits await shippers who embrace digital solutions to enhance the efficiency and integrity of their logistics services.
When evaluating GPS container tracking solutions, the right GPS tracking solution will:
Improve security
The geofencing aspect and related notifications will alert you if the container leaves a geofenced site. Such measures reduce theft and damages, and they can assist in locating and retrieving stolen cargo.
Automate procedures to save time
GPS tracking technology may use cellular network or satellite connectivity to link with asset management software. Such syncing eliminates manual processes in inventory checks and monitoring. Asset management software can automatically create a visual presentation of all your cargo in one place, which saves time and increases the efficiency of business operations.
Increase revenue
Automating processes like inventory reporting will reduce administrative costs for your business. Such tracking provides accurate information on the location and status of cargo, which improves customer satisfaction and ETA predictability.



 

In Bus services
Some bus companies use GPS trackers to reduce time spend for staffing or for simply having information about where their busses are. .Most GPS trackers are built into the buses themselves.GPS tracking apps—apps have software that can be used on phones, tablets and even computers to monitor movements of individual persons, vehicles and assets in real time.
In Ambulances 
We feel alert as soon as we hear the word Ambulance! Ambulances are always in pursuit of reaching to patients or carrying them to hospitals with least minimum time. Ambulance services, also called as ‘mini-hospitals’ or ‘mobile-hospitals’, can play a vital part in saving one’s life. In a life-death situation, each second counts for ambulance. As ambulances set out each day and night to serve the patients/victims and get them to nearest medical support, GPS tracking system can assist them with its live tracking and other multiple features, and save many more lives. 
Following are some of the important reasons why GPS tracking device is essential for ambulance services- 
Assign the Nearest Ambulance 
Assess Driver’s behaviour 
Send Real-time Data to Hospital Authorities 
Curtail Unnecessary Expenses 
Securing the ambulance 
Maintain Recommended Temperature for Drugs or Medicines 
Multiple Admin Access 
SOS & alerts

How does GPS work?
GPS is a system of 30+ navigation satellites orbiting the earth. We know where they are in space because they constantly transmit information about their position and current time to Earth in the form of radio signals.
A GPS receiver listens to these signals. Once the receiver calculates its distance from at least three GPS satellites, it can figure out where you are.
This process is known as Trilateration.

Neo 6m GPS Module:- 
The module's brain is a GPS chip made by U-blox called the NEO-6M. The chip is less than the size of a postage stamp, but it contains a surprising number of characteristics.

GPS Module NEO-6M Chip
It has a maximum tracking sensitivity of -161 dB and can monitor up to 22 satellites across 50 channels while using only 45 mA of current.

It can update its location five times in a second with a 2.5m horizontal position precision, which is faster than conventional GPS units. Additionally, the Time-To-First-Fix (TTFF) of the U-blox 6 positioning engine is less than one second.
Power Save Mode is one of the chip's best features (PSM). This enables a decrease in system power usage by selectively turning on and off specific receiver components. As a result, the module now uses only 11mA, which makes it appropriate for power-sensitive applications like GPS wristwatches.

CHAPTER-2: PROJECT MANAGEMENT
2.1 PROJECT PLANNING
2.1.1 Project Development Approach & Planning (Development Model, etc.)
 
Fig 8 Proposed Development Model
 
The Prototyping model is also a popular software development life cycle model. The prototyping model can be considered to be an extension of the Iterative Waterfall model. This model suggests building a working Prototype of the system, before the development of the product
A prototype is a toy and crude implementation of a system. It has limited functional capabilities, low reliability, or inefficient performance as compared to the actual software. A prototype can be built very quickly by using several shortcuts by developing inefficient, inaccurate or dummy functions.
Necessity of the Prototyping Model –
•	It is advantageous to develop the Graphical User Interface (GUI) part of a software using the Prototyping Model. Through prototype, the user can experiment with a working user interface and they can suggest any change if needed.
•	The prototyping model is especially useful when the exact technical solutions are unclear to the development team. A prototype can help them to critically examine the technical issues associated with the product development. The lack of familiarity with a required development technology is a technical risk. This can be resolved by developing a prototype to understand the issues and accommodate the changes in the next iteration.
Phases of Prototyping Model –
The Prototyping Model of software development is graphically shown in the figure below. The software is developed through two major activities – one is prototype construction and another is iterative waterfall based software development.
Prototype Development – Prototype development starts with an initial requirements gathering phase. A quick design is carried out and a prototype is built. The developed prototype is submitted to the customer for evaluation. Based on the customer feedback, the requirements are refined and the prototype is suitably modified. This cycle of obtaining customer feedback and modifying the prototype continues till the customer approves the prototype.
Iterative Development – Once the customer approves the prototype, the actual software is developed using the iterative waterfall approach. In spite of the availability of a working prototype, the SRS document is usually needed to be developed since the SRS Document is invaluable for carrying out tractability analysis, verification and test case design during later phases.
The code for the prototype is usually thrown away. However, the experience gathered from developing the prototype helps a great deal in developing the actual software. By constructing the prototype and submitting it for user evaluation, many customer requirements get properly defined and technical issues get resolved by experimenting with the prototype. This minimises later change requests from the customer and the associated redesign costs.
Advantages of Prototyping Model – This model is most appropriate for the projects that suffer from technical and requirements risks. A constructed prototype helps to overcome these risks.
Disadvantages of Prototyping Model –
•	Cost of the development of the software by using prototyping model can increase in various cases where the risks are very less.
•	It may take more time to develop a software by using Prototyping model.
•	The Prototyping model is effective only for those projects for which the risks can be identified before the development starts. Since the prototype is developed at the start of the project, so the Prototyping model is ineffective for risks that identified after the development phase starts.
